# Digital Mock-Up in PowerPoint

In this example the menu [menuInfographics6.pptx](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/menuInfographics6.pptx) that was converted from Java to MicroVBA ([macro.txt](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/MicroVBA%20Interpreter/macro.txt)) and then imported in PowerPoint using the [MicroVba interpreter](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/MicroVBA%20Interpreter/ReadMicroVBA.pptm) is used to simulate the menu behavior. This is ideal to be used as a **digital mock-up** before delivering the program.

## Protecting a Design with Automatic Watermark
Once inside PowerPoint the design cannot be correctly converted to other vector formats from PowerPoint. This is a desirable feature coming from the fact that Microsoft actually hides how it really handles its objects internally. Thus, this  can function as a kind of watermark. Thanks to this feature, objects once imported into PowerPoint they cannot be copied to automatically generate the interface from it. It is an ideal way to present a product (either a design or an interface object, as the menu in this case) remotely without the danger of having the design copied. 

### The Hidden Side of PowerPoint Objects
Many details on how Microsoft manages PowerPoint objects are hidden even from VBA macros. An example of this is how subpaths are managed, since "moveto" commands are not available to users to add nodes using the **BuildFreeform**. This problem is shown in [Understanding PowerPoint Internal Path Representation](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/README.md#understanding-powerpoint-internal-path-representation). Actually this title should have been _"How to create subpaths even though commands to create them are clearly missing"_. 
Therefore, the technique presented in [Contructing Paths in PowerPoint](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/README.md#contructing-paths-in-powerpoint) is actually a hack to bypass this problem. Fortunately this hack and the properties unavailable to VBA play in our favor to avoid having the design copied. Obviously it still can be hacked, provided the hacker is aware of the fact that the hack we used actualy allows distinguishing the different subpaths inside the path and _"decoding"_ them back to something everyone can understand. But that is maybe too much work to worth the time of doing it.

Another example of hidden features are texts formatted inside _"TextBoxes"_. Examining these objects with VBA debugger unveils the mystery on how Microsoft handles fonts and other formatting features such as words with different font sizes in a string. It offers a way to set the fonts in _"TextBoxes"_ using VBA but not how to read them when they are created in Powerpoint. In reality, when one creates a _"TextBox"_ in PowerPoint, the "Font Name" field is empty. 
Obviously there must be some sort of formatted string language that does not appear to the user in VBA and that is apparently not documented.
